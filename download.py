"""
AS: I think this should be wrapped in if __name__ == '__main__' ... could be totally wrong ngl
TW: yeah the question is how do I start a session, I was thinking of maube using while True: and then have it wrap to an input if that makes sense

mmh yeah like just let the user input whatever they like and the system would stay running?
TW:yes, because I hate typing in python download.py everytime

TW: also having a way to distinguish when you are downloading during an actual party or not by activating "session"
TW: making the recommender soon for this, just need to finish the objects

oh yea

i'd clean this up a bit before the recommender stuff tbh

TW: yes, this is what I am thinking, I agree
